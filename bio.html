        <p>
            Aleesha was born on Mountain Home AFB, ID and spent the majority of her childhood moving around, eventually ending up in Illinois in 2003. 
            Her father was a huge classic rock fan and instilled her love for music when she was very young. 
            When her sister picked up a guitar as a teenager, Aleesha quickly followed by asking her dad to buy her a bass guitar. 
            She has played off and on ever since, but really got serious when joining Kurti and the Hursti Boys. Her favorite band is blink-182. 
            She is a software developer on the side.

            Ryan says "At that age I did not take them as seriously as I should have. I could have been a lot better off now if i would've." 
            Ryan join his local school band in the fifth grade, and was in it up to his senior year of highschool. 
            While Ryan was growing up his father was a sound engineer, and at a young age Ryan began learning the trade.

            Ryan draws inspiration from other drummers such as Buddy Rich, Mike Portnoy, Stephen Taylor, and many more.
            He is always looking to improve himself and be a strong member of the band.
